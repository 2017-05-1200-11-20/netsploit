## Creating your own module

We all get curious, it's in our nature. If you want to add your own splash of flavor to netsploit, go ahead.

___However___, in order for your creativity to work properly (sounds kind of contradicting right?), you need to format your module correctly.

Here is the basic template:

```python
# Your imports here (Try to stay away from external modules, but if you really need it I might make an exception)
from util import *  # This is needed

def run(opts):
    

```
